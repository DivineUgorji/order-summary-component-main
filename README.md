## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to centre a div container.
- Styling and positioning of flex items.
- SVG background images.


### How to postion the last flex item at the end of the container: 

I stryggled with this concept in my project, and below is how I resolved it.

```css
.change-text {
  margin-left: auto;
}
```
The link below provides more insight on how to handle such placing with flex box;

### Continued development
I need to read up on the following concepts:
- CSS positioning
- SVG's in CSS
- Control of background images in CSS.


### Useful resources

- [Box shadow](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/) - This helped me to understand how to use box shadows in my project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Using SVG as background image](https://youtu.be/xjHoKTIwENY) - This is an amazing short video tutorial, which helped me to understand how to place the svg background image in this project. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept or working on this project.
